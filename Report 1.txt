***ABSTRACT***
Big data not only means a huge amount of data but also a data which is high in variety.Recent times have seen a massive jump in the 
amount of data available. It is difficult to gain valuable insights and knowledge from the datasets by traditional techniques. The rising trend 
of data science in the past years has also meant a sharp rise in data analysis techniques. Modern tools and techniques save a lot of time in hefty 
processes and allow to finish the work of days in minutes. This paper aims to analyze some of the different analytics methods and tools which 
can be applied to big data, as well as the opportunities provided by the application of big data analytics in various decision domains. 
Data Analysis is process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data to  discover useful information, informing conclusions, and 
supporting decision-making. Data Analysis can be broadly classified into Quantitative Data Analysis and Qualitative data analysis. EDA 
focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predictive analytics focuses 
on the application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while text analytics applies statistical, linguistic, and structural 
techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of unstructured data.

***PROBLEM STATEMENT***

Analysing Coils Data of Pickling Line. The objective of this project is to determine the best and the not ok coil among all the coils present in data 
stored for 1 month. By writing Python Modules to inspect, clean & transform data, it is possible to make estimation of a possible range which is
best to run a coil. It has been taken into account the fact that a coil may not always run in the given standard values for the respective parameters.
This analysis helps to determine highly increasing or decreasing values present in the data.  

***OBJECTIVE***  
The main objective of data analysis is to arrange the constantly increasing data ranging from its highest value to its lowest value in organize 
manner to derive valuable information. Organizing data aids to many statistical approaches and analysation of the information through 
various viewpoints. To extract information in order to utilize the information gained to make better decisions. To implement various data analysis 
techniques like Exploratory Data Analysis, Confirmatory Data Analysis etc.
